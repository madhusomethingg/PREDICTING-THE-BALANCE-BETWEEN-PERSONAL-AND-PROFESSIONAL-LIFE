# PREDICTING-THE-BALANCE-BETWEEN-PERSONAL-AND-PROFESSIONAL-LIFE

This research delves into the intricacies of work-life balance dynamics, employing machine learning to predict factors influencing equilibrium. Leveraging a dataset from https://authentic-happiness.com/ with 15,973 responses and 23 questions, five key dimensions emerge from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): "Healthy Body," "Healthy Mind," "Expertise," "Connection," and "Meaning." The study employs extensive regression models, incorporating Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for interpretability. PCA enhances visualization, unveiling latent structures in the relationships between predictors and the target variable. A Stacking Ensemble synergizes diverse models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Ridge, Lasso, and others, utilizing a meta-regressor (Random Forest). Performance metrics such as MSE and RÂ² guide the evaluation of individual models and the ensemble. This holistic approach contributes valuable insights into work-life balance, informing personal choices, organizational strategies, and policy decisions. The application of machine learning underscores its potential in addressing contemporary challenges related to achieving a harmonious work-life equilibrium.This research contributes valuable insights into the intricate factors that underlie work-life balance, offering a data-driven perspective that can inform personal choices, organizational strategies, and policy decisions. The application of machine learning techniques underscores the potential for addressing contemporary challenges associated with achieving a harmonious work-life equilibrium.
